      <p>
        Through my previous job at a start-up company I had the opportunity to
        use many different tools that are commonly found in the field of
        front-end development. HTML, CSS, JavaScript and APIâ€™s are at the top of
        the list as fundamentals for front-enders but I have also gotten the
        opportunity to use tools like git, React.js, NPM and Sass to name a few.
