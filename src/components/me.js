      <p>
        If you are looking for a solution driven frontend developer with an eye
        for great UX, you have come to the right place! I am a fast learner, I
        work well in groups, I listen and I share. I believe that the experience
        I have within multimedia design and front-end development makes me a
        good candidate for a frontend developer position at your company and I
        look forward to hearing from you.
